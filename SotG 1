Is this what they call MVVM pattern? 

Barry, 12:58 PM
Not exactly 


Barry, 7:00 PM
M VM V is Model, View and ViewModel, Model stores the data, View only views/edits the data on the page, the ViewModel is where all the business logic occurs, our logic is very simple, but we may have to implement the ViewModel aspect before wee are finished.
